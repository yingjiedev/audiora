## About Audiora

Audiora is an open-source music app built on MusicFree. It retains the upstream project's general plugin system, user-configured music sources, playback, and download capabilities while focusing maintenance on three areas:

- **Visual refinement**: Build an independent Audiora identity and design system while improving the home screen, player, settings, themes, and interactions.
- **Reduced permissions**: Follow least-privilege principles, remove unnecessary high-risk Android permissions, and prefer the system file picker, scoped storage, and app-private directories.
- **Stronger compliance**: Clearly separate the responsibilities of the app, plugins, music sources, and content. Official builds do not bundle unauthorized music sources, commercial-platform credentials, or access-control bypasses.

Audiora is directly based on [Merilune/MusicFree](https://github.com/Merilune/MusicFree), which descends from [Toskysun/MusicFree](https://github.com/Toskysun/MusicFree) and the original [maotoumao/MusicFree](https://github.com/maotoumao/MusicFree). Audiora improves the client; it is not a music content provider or music service operator.

## Project Scope and Responsibilities

Audiora is a general-purpose client for managing, playing, and syncing music that users own, are authorized to use, or may otherwise access lawfully. The project does not provide music content or operate a music service.

- Audiora does not provide, bundle, or recommend unauthorized music sources, service-specific keys or credentials for commercial platforms, or implementations that bypass DRM or other access controls.
- Plugins and user-configured music sources are selected by the user and may be developed or operated by independent third parties. Providing a general plugin runtime does not mean that the project has reviewed or endorses their content, availability, security, or legality.
- Users must ensure that they have the right to access, play, download, or sync content and must comply with applicable laws, copyright rules, and service terms. Third-party providers and users remain responsible for their respective services and actions as required by law.

If a plugin, example, or project document may infringe your rights, please open an [issue](../../issues) with the source, the basis of your claim, and relevant links so maintainers can review it and take appropriate action, such as removing a link or recommendation.
